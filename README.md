macd apply
macd help
```

#### Arguments

* `<iface>`: Network interface (e.g., `wlan0`).
* `<mac>`: MAC in `XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX` format.

#### Examples

```sh
# Show current MAC on wlan0
macd show wlan0

# Set a specific MAC on wlan0 and save it for reboot
macd set 12:34:56:78:9A:BC wlan0

# Generate and apply a random MAC on wlan0 (also saves it)
macd random wlan0

# Re-apply the last saved MAC (also done automatically on boot)
macd apply
```

Random MAC addresses default to Locally Administered (LAA). Do not spoof OUIs you do not own in environments where policy or compliance applies.

Changing your MAC address may affect network access controls (e.g., MAC filtering) and could violate network policies.
